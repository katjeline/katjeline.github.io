        <p> These species all have famous extraordinary examples. But not only speciale examples from species are extraordinary. Some extinct species were extroardinary as whole and not just one of them. Here are some examples: </p>
        <h3>Koala Lemur (Megaladapis Edwarsi)</h3>
        <p>The Koala Lemur grew to 1.5 meters long , and weighed up to 75 kilograms, possibly more. Its arms were longer than its legs, and they were made for climbing trees. It was too large to leap, and likely spent most of its life on the ground. The Koala Lemur could have traveled on all fours much like an orangutan. Since humans travelled to Madagaskar about 2000 years ago, 17 species of Lemur have gone extinct. The Koala Lemur is one of the most notable because of its size. It made him slow and easy to hunt. The last Koala Lemur died about 500 years ago. </p>

        <h3>The giant Australian python (Wonambi Naracoortensis)</h3>
        <p>The Giant Australian Python was non-venomous and grew more than 4.5 meters. It had recurved teeth without fangs, and constricted its prey. He lacked the jaw flexibility most evolved snakes. This means that in evolutionary therms that this snake was a phase between the lizard and the modern snake. Most scientific estimates say extinction at 40000 years ago, but it's possible they could have survived to 7000 years ago.</p>

        <h3>Great Auk (Pinguinus Impennis)</h3>
        <p>The great auk was a flightless bird that stood about 1 meter tall and had tiny 15-centimeter wings. They lived near places such as Scotland, Norway, Canada, the US, and France for centuries, but only came on land to breed. They had been hunted for thousand of centuries, but in the 1700s the hunting became out of control. Valuable feathers, pelts, meat, oil, and 13-centimeter eggs tempted hunters and collectors. Great auks became endangered, and their rarity only heightened demand. On On July 3, 1844, Sigurour Isleifsson and two other men visited the last breeding colony on Iceland’s Eldey Island. A mother was incubating her egg with her mate nearby. Two of the men strangled the live birds, and the third crushed the egg with his boot. The destructive trio had been hired by a merchant to hunt the birds. These great auks were the last mating pair of their kind ever seen. The last known live great auk was spotted in 1852 at The Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada.</p>

        <h3>Schomburgk’s Deer (Rucervus Schomburgki)</h3>
        <p>Schomburgk’s deer antlers were believed to contain powers of magic and healing. The species became widely sought by hunters, and fell victim to the traditional medicine trade. During floods, they gathered at high points; this made them especially easy to kill. Boaters targeted them when they had nowhere to run. Human settlement and commercial agriculture destroyed much of their habitat. The last wild Schomburgk’s deer was killed in 1932. The last domesticated one died in 1938. Some believe the deer still lives, but scientific observations have not validated this theory.</p>

        <h3>Jamaican Giant Galliwasp (Celestus Occiduus)</h3>
        <p>The last recorded sighting of a Jamaican giant galliwasp occurred in 1840. Also known as a sinking galliwasp, it grew to around 60 centimters long and terrified locals. Its extinction was likely due to the introduction of predatorsin Jamaica. Habitat destruction by humans may have also played a part in their elimination. Galliwasps are a subject of fables. Jamaican natives believe the animal is venomous. After a bite, legend explains, the galliwasp and the person who was bitten will head for water. The first to reach it will live. The other will die. Very little is known about this swamp-dwelling lizard, though we can tell it ate fish and fruit. Few specimens exist today. Bleached and preserved Jamaican giant galliwasps are kept at a small number of museums.</p>

        <h3>Giant Teratorn (Argentavis Magnificens)</h3>
        <p>Its skeleton was discovered in Miocene rocks in Argentina, indicating this species lived in South America six million years ago. It’s the largest flying bird on record. This creature could grow to more than 1.8 meters tall, with an impressive wingspan of 6–8 meters. The heaviest among them weighed more than 68 kilograms. The giant teratorn’s chest muscles would not support excessive flapping; it seems the bird mostly soared through the air, either hunting or searching for prey. The giant teratorn’s skull structure suggests it swallowed prey whole. Lifespan is estimated to have been between 50–100 years.</p>

        <h3>Barbary Lion (Panthera Leo Leo)</h3>
        <p>The regal Barbary lion used to roam North Africa freely. This species was unique as it traveled, not in prides, but in pairs or small family groups. The Barbary lion was a highly recognizable and stunning creature with a distinctive head shape and mane. A male’s extra-long fur surrounded the face, and grew from the chest and stomach as well. The last wild Barbary lion was shot in Morocco in 1927. Since the sultan of Morocco owned domesticated Barbary lions, a small number of ancestors survived in captivity. These royal pets were transferred to Moroccan and European zoos for show and breeding. This isn’t the only time they’ve been kept out of the wild. Barbary lions were also used in combat against gladiators during the Roman Empire. </p>

        <h3>Laughing Owl (Sceloglaux Albifacies)</h3>
        <p>The Sceloglaux albifacies laughing owl was native to New Zealand. It became rare in the mid-1800s.it was last spotted in 1914. Unconfirmed reports suggest it might have survived up until the 1930s. The laughing owl’s hoot sounds like a creepy cackle or madman’s snicker. It nested on rocks around forest borders and in open country. Some were taken into captivity. They thrived as pets, and even laid eggs without encouragement. In the wild, human settlement and habitat destruction caused them to change their diet. They switched from eating sizable birds and lizards to more mammals. After this dietary adjustment, natural predators likely hunted them to extinction. Grazing and agricultural burning could have also influenced their quick extinction.</p>

        <h3>Bluebuck (Hippotragus Leucophaeus)</h3>
        <p>This animal’s black and yellow coloring gave its fur a blue appearance, though the species never actually grew blue fur. It was native to southern Africa. Grassy open areas were ideal for grazing, and bluebucks also enjoyed chomping on bark. They were social creatures, and most likely nomadic. African lions, hyenas, and leopards hunted them before humans arrived. The population began to decline noticeably around 2,000 years ago. This is when competing livestock were introduced into their habitat. Bluebucks had become rather rare by the 18th century. Predators, climate change, hunting, disease, and even the presence of animals, such as sheep, in their territory may have contributed to their extinction. The last known bluebuck was shot in 1799.</p>

        <h3>Woolly Rhinoceros (Coelodonta Antiquitatis)</h3>
        <p>Fossils of the Woolly Rhinoceros up to 3.6 million years old have been recovered from Asia, Europe, and North Africa—the oldest from Tibet. One woolly rhino’s gigantic horns were originally mistaken for prehistoric bird claws. Wear indicates woolly rhinos brushed their horns back and forth on the ground, as modern rhinos do ritualistically. The brushing could have pushed snow and other natural obstacles out of the rhino’s way. Woolly rhinos shared territory with woolly mammoths. Though both were especially populous in Russia, neither crossed the Bering Strait land bridge into North America. Woolly rhinos lasted through many centuries. Caves in France show 30,000-year-old depictions of woolly rhinoceri. They were hunted by primitive humans, and became a common subject of cave art. It’s believed this creature went extinct at the end of the most recent ice age approximately 11,000 years ago.</p>
